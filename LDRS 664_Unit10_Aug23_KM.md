LDRS 664 Unit 10: Bringing it all together 
===========================================

Overview
--------

In this culminating unit you will bring together what you have learned about
creating authentic learning communities for adult learners. Throughout the
course you have explored theoretical foundations of learning communities,
evaluated strategies for creating authentic learning communities, and how to
apply those strategies in a learning/coaching context. In addition, you have
explored teaching and learning through the lens of personal transformation and
considered challenges of leading for an authentic learning environment. The
themes you read, blogged and discussed about included identity, perception,
interconnectedness, humility and learning organizations.

Now it is time to develop a personal philosophy of Learning Communities,
exploring what it means to be personally authentic and how to lead authentically
in a learning environment. Your main task will be to consider two subtopics and
write a platform paper that will synthesize your learning about teaching,
learning and context as well as administrative and supervisory aspects of the
role of adult educator. As an adult educator you have the opportunity to be a
transformational leader. The development of a platform of beliefs will provide
substantive proof of your readiness to serve in this capacity as well as
increase your confidence and sense of self-efficacy.

Topic 1: Teaching, Learning and Context
---------------------------------------

**Introduction**

What is your ideal learning environment? You can learn a lot about your own
teaching style from the way you like to be taught. Thinking about teachers
you’ve liked will also give you clues to the sorts of things that are important
to you, such as using critical thinking, humour, precise details, or visual
reinforcement in the lesson. These are practical aspects of the role that you
need to consider in addition to the methods and strategies you have been reading
about in the course and in other certificate courses.

It is important to keep in mind that your personal likes and style will not be
the same as your learners so you need to be flexible enough to build in variety.
Generally, the more collective and participatory the methods, the more effective
and engaging the class experience will be.

### Activity 10.1: Sticky Note Challenge!

Go through the Silberman and Brookfield texts and put a ‘sticky note’ on the
pages of strategies that you like and plan to use. Think about why you like
these facilitation techniques and what they say about your teaching and learning
style.

### Activity 10.2: Learning Styles Video

Watch [this 5 minute video](https://youtu.be/5mApEVWZESA) about the 4 Adult
Learning Styles explained with JC Melvin. <https://youtu.be/5mApEVWZESA>

As you watch, consider how you can best get through to learners. What activities
might you use to motivate, inform, coach for implementation and evaluate how the
information will be applicable and helpful in learners’ lives?

Topic 2: Administrative and supervisory aspects of an adult educator
--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Introduction**

Teaching a group of learners also involves non-instructional duties. Sometimes
there is a tension between our philosophical beliefs about authentic teaching
and learning and the organizational realities we face. In addition to creating
authentic learning experiences, your teaching responsibilities will often
require you to track and report on learners’ progress, submit grades or summary
reports to the organization, order textbooks or supplies, work with an assistant
such as a learning coach or teacher assistant, book classrooms…. The
possibilities are many! Beyond your own classroom, you may be asked to
contribute to committees and other meetings about the operational aspects of the
education facility. Few educators work alone. We are almost all part of an
organizational context which has implications for our work. Organizations have
expectations and the relationship between the adult educator and the
organization is important to consider. Sometimes what is asked of us
organizationally conflicts with our philosophy of how to carry out assessment or
what it means to advise and guide students on their educational journey. The
time invested in meetings is important for the organization to flourish and
enable the teaching and learning to happen at all yet, this time commitment can
detract from planning authentic learning experiences and having the time to give
extensive formative feedback. Every organization is driven by a set of values
which will apply to the educational environment. If there is an outside funder
for example, then reports to demonstrate progress and results will need great
care and handling since this is what makes programs possible at all. Educators
must not only promote what they consider the best way to do things but also take
into account what others expect and need from the program. During this course
you have focused on how to develop authentic learning communities. Authentic
learning communities take place within organizational contexts. Priorities
between these two – developing authentic learning communities and organizational
realities are not always aligned. However, it behooves the critical thinker to
figure out how to align them as much as possible. This is a challenge worth
embracing in order to be personally and professionally fulfilled.

>   “No matter how hopeful our dialogue has been, no matter how many of our
>   colleagues have embraced a new vision, no matter how many practical
>   possibilities we have explored, someone will say, ‘These are wonderful
>   ideas, but every last one of them will be defeated by conditions in my
>   school’” (Palmer, 2017, p. 170).

Palmer (2017) suggests that change begins when we, as individual teachers and
facilitators, “make an inward decision to live *‘divided no more,’* finding a
center for their lives outside of institutions” and “begin to discover one
another and form *communities of congruence* that offer mutual support and
opportunities to develop a shared vision” (pp. 172-3).

### Activity 10.3: Platform Paper (40%)

This is a two-part assignment. Please organize your paper with subheadings
according to the following.

Part A:

In the first part, consider teaching, learning and context with a focus on
learning communities. In this section depict your ideal adult learning
environment in all its facets. Consider student outcomes, instructional climate,
instructional organization, community, personal beliefs. Draw on your philosophy
of learning communities from Unit 5 and one of the three learning community
models discussed in units 4-5.

Part B:

In the second part, consider the administrative or supervisory aspects of your
role as an adult educator. Describe the means to realize these educational
goals. In what ways will you achieve the vision? What will be your routine
behaviours?

You are encouraged to write a contextualized platform grounded in your
experience and to consider this as a realistic rather than hypothetical
exercise.

You will write and post a draft to your blog for peer review. Peer reviewers
will be assigned in advance. It is important to keep the rubric in mind as you
complete your peer review.

STUDENTS.

### Activity 10.4: Closing Song

As a closing activity, enjoy listening to this song. The whole effort of taking
this certificate program, of wanting to be involved in transforming others
through education and indeed of all our efforts in life, is in anticipation of
something more - something ‘fresh and green’. And here is a song to inspire your
continued efforts:

<https://soundcloud.com/steve_bell/fresh-and-green>

>   **FRESH AND GREEN (Psalm 92)**

>   *music and lyrics by Steve Bell*

>   Fresh and green we will remain

>   Bearing fruit to a ripe old age

>   Happy to tell about Your name

>   A blessed endeavour

>   The righteous flourish like the palm

>   And grow like cedars of Lebanon

>   Planted in the courts of God

>   Forever and ever

>   The senseless person doesn’t know

>   The wonders of Your glory

>   And yet their hoppers overflow

>   But they don’t understand

>   That folly springs up like the grass

>   And spreads throughout these vast lands

>   But harvesting will come to pass

>   When everything is shown

>   Everything will be exposed

>   Fresh and green…

>   It is so good to sing of You

>   At the first light of the morning

>   And at night Your faithfulness review

>   Before I close my eyes

>   And sometimes in the dimming light

>   I stumble on Your glory

>   That overwhelming sudden fright

>   But not the daunting kind

>   It’s so hard to describe

Unit Summary
------------

In this unit, you have had the opportunity to discern your teaching style and
beliefs as well as consider certain pragmatic aspects of the role. Through
writing the platform paper you had the opportunity to think critically about
what you’ve learned in this course about authentic learning communities, your
personal and professional identity. Teaching and coaching adults is not easy –
challenges and indeed failures are to be expected no matter how much experience
you have. But it is a very rewarding vocation if you put in the thought, time
and talent into good content, design and facilitation.

In the role of adult educator, you have the opportunity to change lives and
cultivate growth of the mind and spirit. May the work you undertake grow within
you a greatness of vision, stir your spirit so that you can see and love the
common good more, and create an environment where all whom you serve can thrive.

Checking your Learning
----------------------

Use the learning outcomes for this unit as a checklist of understanding before
you move to the next unit. Can you:

-   describe your ideal adult learning environment?

-   describe the supervisory and administrative aspects for which you may be
    accountable?

-   Articulate your platform of beliefs regarding adult learning for a specific
    context/organization?
