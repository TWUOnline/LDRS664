<h4>Unit Overview</h4>
Creating authentic learning communities begins with personal authenticity -- with knowing one's self. Palmer (1998) argues that "good teaching comes from the<em> identity</em> and <em>integrity</em> of the teacher" (p. 13, italics added).

<strong>Identity:</strong> Knowing ourselves as teachers means that we must explore our inner landscape. We must be aware of the character traits, personal experiences, values, beliefs, and cultural environment in which we were raised and now live. These elements are part of our identity -- and we bring our identity with us into the classroom and learning spaces in which we coach and teach others (Palmer, 1998).

<strong>Integrity:</strong> So, too, our integrity comes with us into the learning spaces in which we teach. Integrity, from Palmer's (1998) discussion, is not about ethics, but about an integrated sense of self -- a self that is whole, integrating life experiences and values and beliefs in a meaningful, authentic way.

Whether we are aware of it or not, our integrity and identity are part of who we are as teachers. It is on this foundation that we build connections with students, and are able to invite them into spaces where personal transformation  and authentic learning will take place.

<strong>[I'm wondering whether you'd like to move any of the quotes or content from the Overview to the Topics?  We could shorten it a bit, to give students a brief summary of what they'll be learning, not necessarily explaining the topics yet.]</strong>

As <a href="http://billmoyers.com/content/conversation-maya-angelou" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maya Angelou</a> discusses, belonging to one's self is an ongoing journey -- a journey that is not always easy. <strong>[Do we need a link here?  I assume we don't want students to watch the video yet?]</strong>
<blockquote>"I belong to myself."

-- Maya Angelou, 1973</blockquote>
In <em>Braving the Wilderness: The Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone, </em>Brene Brown (2017) discusses this universal human need for belonging -- and the importance of belonging authentically. She contrasts a true sense of "belonging" to "fitting in" -- a sense of being accepted, but not as one's true self.
<blockquote>"We want to be part of something, but we need it to be real -- not conditional or fake or constantly up for negotiation. We need true belonging."

-- Brene Brown (2017, p. 31)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"You will always belong anywhere you show up as yourself and talk about yourself and your work in a real way."

-- Brene Brown (2017, p. 26)</blockquote>
It is Palmer's (1998) contention that our own sense of identity and integrity provide a foundation for creating authentic communities.
<blockquote>"At home in our own souls, we become more at home with each other"

-- Parker Palmer (1998, p. 5)</blockquote>
In our role as teachers, we are asked to connect students with new ways of thinking and knowing, as well as new knowledge. But the first (and most important) connections we make (and the connections on which all learning is built) are connections between students, and between students and teachers.
<blockquote>"Good teachers join self and subject and students in the fabric of life"

-- Parker Palmer (1998, p. 11)</blockquote>
Authenticity is also an essential ingredient for effective leadership. Authentic leadership includes elements of both self-knowledge and identity, as well as collaboration with others within the context of relationship (Northhouse, 2019). Avolio, Walumbwa and Weber (2009) provide a model of authentic leadership that includes "self-awareness, internalized moral perspective, balanced processing, and relational transparency" (as cited in Northhouse, 2019, p. 198).

Leadership then, like teaching, relies not just on the relationships that teachers form with learners, but also on the identity of the teacher. "Authentic leaders understand their own <em>values</em> and <em>behave </em>toward others based on these values" (Northouse, 2019, p. 201).
