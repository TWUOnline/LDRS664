As we began to explore in Unit 1, creating authentic learning communities begins with personal authenticity -- with knowing one's self. Palmer (2017) argues that "good teaching comes from the<em> identity</em> and <em>integrity</em> of the teacher" (p. 13, italics added).

In this unit, we will explore the importance of identity and integrity as teachers/coaches, considering our own sense of identity as teachers, and what it means to belong to one’s self.

&nbsp;

<strong>Topics</strong>

Unit 2 focuses on two guiding questions:

1: What is my identity as a teacher/facilitator?
2: What does it mean for me to be an authentic teacher/facilitator?

&nbsp;
