<h3>Overview</h3>
Welcome to LDRS 664 Creating Authentic Learning Communities!

As humans, we long for authenticity in our relationships. We want to feel "at home" in the organizations that are part of our lives -- our families, schools, communities, places of worship. We seek connection. We search for a place where we are known.

This sense of being "at home" is essential to our experience as learners. Deep, authentic learning happens in spaces where we feel connected with others -- places and spaces where we are known. Palmer (1998) refers to this as the "spiritual quest for connectedness" (p. 5).

In this course, we will explore together the theoretical foundations of learning communities, evaluating key elements essential to creating authentic learning communities, where learners are known and learning is authentic. In this unit, we will engage with the writings of Parker Palmer, a teacher and writer who has written several important works regarding the essential role of authenticity in teaching and learning.

In addition to reading, throughout this course, we will also listen to music and view several short films that will allow us to more deeply engage with the concepts of belonging and authenticity within the teaching/learning experience.
<h3>Topics</h3>
Unit 1 focuses on two guiding questions:
<ol>
 	<li>What does it mean to be authentic in teaching and learning?</li>
