<h3><strong>Welcome to LDRS 664 Creating Authentic Learning Communities!</strong></h3>
As humans, we long for authenticity in our relationships. We want to feel "at home" in the organizations that are part of our lives -- our families, schools, communities, places of worship. We seek connection. We search for a place where we are known.

This sense of being "at home" is essential to our experience as learners. Deep, authentic learning happens in spaces where we feel connected with others -- places and spaces where we are known. Palmer (1998) refers to this as the "spiritual quest for connectedness" (p. 5).

In this course, we will explore together the theoretical foundations of learning communities, evaluating key elements essential to creating authentic learning communities, where learners are known and learning is authentic. In this unit, we will engage with the writings of Parker Palmer, a teacher and writer who has written several important works regarding the essential role of authenticity in teaching and learning.

In addition to reading, throughout this course, we will also listen to music and view several short films that will allow us to more deeply engage with the concepts of belonging and authenticity within the teaching/learning experience.

&nbsp;
<h3>Topics</h3>
Unit 1 focuses on two guiding questions:
<ol>
 	<li>What does it mean to be authentic in teaching and learning?</li>
 	<li>What is the facilitator’s role in creating spaces for authentic learning?</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>

<h3>Learning Cafe</h3>
In this course you will also have the opportunity to connect with other learners in the <em>Learning Cafe</em>.  This is a space for you to chat with your classmates about course topics or other topics of interest.  For this first post, please share a bit about yourself (e.g. hometown, interests, future plans, etc.).  Also answer the question, "What four things are most important in your life?" Feel free to include a picture – of yourself or what you value.
