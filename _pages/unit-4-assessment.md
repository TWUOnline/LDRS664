<h3>Unit 4 Assessments</h3>
<h3>Blog Assignment</h3>
After completing Learning Activities 4.1-3, write a 250-word blog. Provide a brief description of each of the three models (with citations as appropriate). Select the learning community model that most closely aligns with your identity and values as a teacher/facilitator. In your blog, tell your readers the strengths you see in this model, explaining why it resonates with your concepts of teaching and learning.
