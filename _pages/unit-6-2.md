<h1>Unit 6
Authentic Learning and Identity</h1>
As you have explored in units 1-5, personal authenticity refers to genuineness, vulnerability and connectedness.  In units 5-10 we will broaden the lens to consider the adult educator as authentic leader and facilitator in the learning environment. We will engage with the writings of <a href="http://margaretwheatley.com/home/">Margaret Wheatley</a>, a peace activist, philosopher, world traveler and management consultant.  Before you begin the second half of the course, I invite you to take a few minutes to explore her website and get a sense of her work as it relates to creating authentic learning communities. Her book contains powerful concepts that will challenge you to see leadership with a new lens.  She suggests that her book not be read but savoured because the concepts need to be dwelt upon.  I agree that you will get more out the book if you take your time, pause frequently and note ideas in your reflective journal.
