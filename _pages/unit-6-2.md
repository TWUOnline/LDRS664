<h1>Unit 6
Assessment</h1>
Assessment is the systematic collection of information about students’ abilities, characteristics, skills, understanding and knowledge.

Since the purpose of teaching is to help others learn, assessment helps to determine if that is happening.  In order to check if students are learning and, by implication, if our teaching methods are effective, we need to use various methods of assessment.  Sometimes assessment is also used as an evaluation tool to check if students are able to do the actions, or skills stated in the learning outcomes.
