<h1>Unit 8
Democratizing Lifelong Learning</h1>
Why do you want to work in the field of adult education?  A common response from educators is that they want to make a difference. This is the essence of Unit 8 – as adult educators we want to make a difference in people’s lives and in the broader society.

In this unit you will explore the role of the adult educator as an agent of individual transformation and social change. You will learn more about this conceptually and practically through the readings and learning activities this week.
