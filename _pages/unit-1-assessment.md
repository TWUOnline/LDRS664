<h2><strong>Assessment</strong></h2>
<h3>Blog Post Assignment</h3>
<h3>Part 1:</h3>
After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to incorporate Chapters 1 and 3 of Palmer (2017), and write a 150-250 word blog in which you:

<em>List and describe three values you hold related to teaching and learning. Write a personal statement about your identity as a coach/facilitator.</em>

<strong> </strong>
<h3>Part 2:</h3>
After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to write a 150-250 word blog in which you:

<em>Consider the key elements of authentic learning spaces, outlined by Palmer (2017) in Chapter 3. Select two of these elements that you consider to be important. Introduce the element and discuss some practical steps you could take to create an authentic learning space. Respond to at least two other learners, providing additional suggestions regarding the elements they have chosen.</em>

&nbsp;
<h2>Unit 1 Summary</h2>
In this first unit, you have had the opportunity to think and learn about your identify and beliefs about your role as a facilitator/teacher, and consider key elements of authentic learning communities. The hunger for authentic human relationships and authentic learning can and should compel us to consider our own identity and integrity, both as teachers and learners. In our next unit, we will explore ideas related to vulnerability in leadership, and learning to be “at home”  with ourselves so we can, in turn, lead and teach others.

&nbsp;
