<h2><strong>Topic 1: Authenticity in Teaching and Learning</strong></h2>
Teaching and learning are deeply personal experiences. Learning is, by definition, a transformative experience; we change as a result of learning. Teaching is also a transformative experience; we change as a result of teaching.

Figure 1.1: Model designed by Penfold Navarro, C. (2018)

In his book, <em>The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teacher's Life</em>, Parker Palmer (2017)  argues that the "inner landscape of teaching" is an essential foundation out of which authentic learning experiences emerge.

"Teachers possess the power to create conditions that can help students learn a great deal -- or keep them from learning much at all. Teaching is the intentional act of creating those conditions, and good teaching requires that we understand the inner sources of both the intent and the act." -- Palmer (2017, p. 7)

&nbsp;

<strong>Learning Activity 1.1: Reading</strong>

As we explore the importance of the “inner life of the teacher” as a foundation for authentic learning, read Chapter 1: The Heart of a Teacher: Identity and Integrity in Teaching in <em>The Courage to Teach</em> (Palmer, 2017).

For this course, you will keep a Reflective Learning Journal, which will provide the basis for many of your blog posts. Writing can be a powerful learning experience, as we engage in reflection and critical analysis of the new concepts we discover. Through regular writing, we are challenged to think critically, organize, and integrate these new concepts with our prior understanding, as you prepare for your future teaching/coaching.

As you read, consider the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>In your Reflective Learning Journal, write a summary sentence for each major idea/concept that relates to your understanding of what it means to be a teacher/facilitator/coach.</li>
 	<li>Choose the concept that most resonates with you and write a short paragraph summary of this concept, applied to your professional/personal context.</li>
 	<li>Formulate one question that emerged from this reading that you will explore and consider in future course readings and blog posts.</li>
 	<li>As you prepare your blog post, refer to these notes.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Topic 2: Identity and Integrity as a Coach/Facilitator</strong>

Palmer (2017) argues that identity and integrity are foundational to good teaching. From Palmer’s perspective, this means we must endeavour to know ourselves and to create learning spaces that foster integrity in our students, allowing them to authentically engage with each other, with us, and with the discipline we are studying.

In order to have integrity, we must know our own values and strengths, our own beliefs about teaching and learning, and our own perspective on the work we are doing.

"If the work we do lacks integrity for us, then we, the work, and the people we do it with will suffer." -- Palmer (2017, p. 16)

&nbsp;

<strong>Learning Activity 1.2: Reflect, View, and Respond </strong>

As teachers, it’s important to identify and reflect on your own values. Consider why you are taking this course.  Why do you want to coach/facilitate learning? What are your beliefs about learning? What are your values about learning? What are your strengths? Where do you need help?

Watch the following video, “What is your Why?”  Next, take some time to answer the questions above in your Reflective Learning journal.  Then, if you feel comfortable doing so, answer this question in our Learning Café.  “Why do you want to be a learning facilitator?”

&nbsp;

<strong>Topic 3: Creating Authentic Learning Spaces</strong>

"For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as <strong>I also have been fully known</strong>."

-- 1 Corinthians 13:12 (ESV)

As we begin thinking about creating authentic learning spaces, consider a time when you have felt “at home” within a learning community, whether in formal education, your faith community, or your employment. What elements made that learning space feel like “home?”

In the song, Home, Phillip Phillips sings about the universal need we share as humans to “belong.” Take a moment now to listen to this song, considering what the lyrics say about what it means to belong.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Just know you’re not alone
'Cause I’m going to make this place your home."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">-- Phillip Phillips, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoRkntoHkIE">Home</a></p>
In order for students to authentically learn, we must create learning spaces that are safe, where students know and feel that they belong. Palmer (2017) refers to this need for belonging as the "spiritual quest for connectedness."

If a sense of belonging provides a foundation for learning, then in our role as teachers, facilitators, or coaches, we must endeavour to create spaces where students know and feel that they belong.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Good teachers possess a capacity for connectedness. They are able to weave a complex web of connections among themselves, their subjects, and their students so that students can learn to weave a world for themselves." -- Palmer (2017, p. 11)</p>
But how is this done?

In “<em>To Know As We Are Known,</em>” Palmer (1993) suggests that learning spaces must include openness, boundaries, and an air of hospitality. These learning spaces, according to Palmer (1993) can be spaces “both to be and to become” (p. 71).

&nbsp;

<strong>Learning Activity 1.3</strong>

<em>Rank the following strategies according to your comfort level. For each strategy, list one practical action you can take in an online learning environment (as facilitator or learner) to create an authentic learning space that is hospitable and open.</em>

“To study with a teacher who not only<strong> speaks</strong> but l<strong>istens</strong>, who not <strong>only gives answers</strong> but <strong>asks questions</strong> and <strong>welcomes our insights</strong>, who <strong>provides information and theories</strong> that <strong>do not close doors</strong> but <strong>open new ones</strong>, who <strong>encourages students</strong> to help each other learn – to study with such a teacher is to know the power of a learning space” (Palmer, 1997, pp. 70-71)
<ol>
 	<li>Speaking</li>
 	<li>Listening</li>
 	<li>Giving answers</li>
 	<li>Asking questions</li>
 	<li>Providing information/theories that open doors</li>
 	<li>Encouraging students to help each other learn</li>
</ol>
As you read the discussion of authentic learning environments in Herrington and Oliver (2000), consider how the elements they discuss align with or differ from Palmer’s (2017) description of learning communities.
<h4>Questions to Consider</h4>
After completing the activities above, consider the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>What are the important values that will guide my teaching/facilitation?</li>
 	<li>What elements matter most to me in a learning community?</li>
 	<li>What can I do to create hospitable learning spaces?</li>
</ul>
