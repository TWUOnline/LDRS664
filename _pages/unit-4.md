<h1>Unit 4: Learning Communities</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
In this unit, we will review several models of “learning communities” that provide visual representations of educational learning environments. A learning community can be created within a specific course, academic program, or professional context. Learning communities can be found across university campuses and often include a set of interdisciplinary, paired-courses that students take as a cohort. They can be grounded in residence halls with an integration of living and learning. Or, they can be developed in formal educational environments with a focus on students learning together as a cohort. Professional learning communities have also emerged as an important force in education and other fields, as colleagues gather around a shared interest, a focus on continuous quality improvement, and a shared discipline.

Learning communities are authentic, emotionally-safe and inclusive spaces (whether physical or virtual) where learners and teachers come together to engage in deep learning. By definition, a learning community includes both LEARNING and COMMUNITY.

Unit 4 focuses on two guiding questions:
<ol>
 	<li>What is a learning community?</li>
 	<li>What key elements are essential to learning communities?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Topics</h2>
In this unit, our topics explore three different models of learning communities.
<ol>
 	<li>Pyramid Model of Learning Communities (Brower &amp; Dettinger, 1998)</li>
 	<li>The Community of Truth (Palmer, 2017)</li>
 	<li>Trinity Community of Inquiry (Madland, 2017)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
When you have completed this unit you should be able to:
<ul>
 	<li>Describe elements of an authentic learning community</li>
 	<li>Compare learning community models</li>
</ul>
<h2>Learning Activity Checklist</h2>
These learning activities will engage you in considering the guiding questions for this unit. As you plan your week, be sure to include time for these important learning activities.
