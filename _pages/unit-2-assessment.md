<h3>Assignment: Blog Post</h3>
For this blog post activity, you will use the“Liberating Structures” strategy of the “Nine Whys” to consider your own identity as a teacher/facilitator.

Identify someone in your life who knows you well, with whom you have a history of talking about your goals or dreams. Ask them to participate in this exercise with you.
<ol>
 	<li>Begin by telling them why you are taking this course, as well as why you want to engage in teaching/coaching/facilitation.</li>
 	<li>When you have finished talking, your “Nine Whys” partner will ask you Why is that important to you?</li>
 	<li>Your partner should continue asking that question up to nine times, or until you cannot go any deeper.</li>
 	<li>At this point, you will have uncovered something fundamental about your identity as a teacher/facilitator.</li>
</ol>
Write 250 word blog post on this process, including your “why” for teaching/facilitating.

<h3>Checking your Learning</h3>
Use the learning outcomes for this unit as a checklist of understanding before you move to the next unit. Can you:
<ul>
 	<li>articulate a sense of identity as a teacher/facilitator?</li>
 	<li>analyze the influence of teacher authenticity on student learning?</li>
</ul>
