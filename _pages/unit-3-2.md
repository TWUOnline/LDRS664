<h1>Unit 3
Belonging to Others</h1>
In our role as teachers, we are asked to connect students with content. But the first (and most important) connections we make (and the connections on which all learning is built) are connections between students, and between students and teachers.
"Good teachers join self and subject and students in the fabric of life" - Parker Palmer (1998, p. 11)
