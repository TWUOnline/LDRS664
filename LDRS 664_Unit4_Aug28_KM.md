Unit 4: Learning Communities 
=============================

Overview
--------

In this unit, we will review several models of “learning communities” that
provide visual representations of educational learning environments. A learning
community can be created within a specific course, academic program, or
professional context. Learning communities can be found across university
campuses and often include a set of interdisciplinary, paired-courses that
students take as a cohort. They can be grounded in residence halls with an
integration of living and learning. Or, they can be developed in formal
educational environments with a focus on students learning together as a cohort.
Professional learning communities have also emerged as an important force in
education and other fields, as colleagues gather around a shared interest, a
focus on continuous quality improvement, and a shared discipline.

Learning communities are authentic, emotionally-safe and inclusive spaces
(whether physical or virtual) where learners and teachers come together to
engage in deep learning. By definition, a learning community includes both
LEARNING and COMMUNITY.

Unit 4 focuses on 2 guiding questions:

1.  What is a learning community?

2.  What key elements are essential to learning communities?

Topics
------

In this unit, our topics explore three different models of learning communities.

1.  Pyramid Model of Learning Communities (Brower & Dettinger, 1998)

2.  The Community of Truth (Palmer, 2017)

3.  Trinity Community of Inquiry (Madland, 2017)

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

When you have completed this unit you should be able to:

1.  Describe elements of an authentic learning community

2.  Compare learning community models

**Topic 1: Learning Community Pyramid**

The Learning Community Pyramid, developed by Bower & Dettinger (1998) includes
academic, social, and physical components. They describe academic components as
those that focus on the curriculum and learning that takes place. The social
components are the elements of trust and inclusivity that create space for
community. The physical component is the “place or facility where the community
meets or resides” (Bower & Dettinger, 1998, p. 17). In the case of this course,
that “place” is the course hub.

Building on the foundation of social, physical, and academic elements, Bower and
Dettinger (1998) contend that learning communities also include three areas of
responsibility: ethical responsibility, civic responsibility, and professional
responsibility (p. 17).

According to Bower & Dettinger (1998), “Learning communities, to be considered
as such, must integrate academic subject matter and social interactions while
providing the physical space or facility for an intellectually stimulating
environment to emerge. Furthermore, learning communities must be designed to
develop a triad of responsibilities within students—professional, ethical, and
civic” (p. 16).

As you consider the learning community you will facilitate, consider how you
might develop or model professional, ethical, and civic responsibility within
that community. Do you think leaders should develop these same areas of
responsibility with the organizations or companies they lead?

#### Learning Activity 4.1: 

Read “What IS a Learning Community?” (Bower & Dettinger, 1998). **[Get link from
TWU library]**

In your Reflective Journal, write down three strengths of this learning
community model. Write 2-3 questions you have about this learning community. Do
you think this model accurately reflects the type of learning community you want
to create? Why or Why not? As we compare the other two models, feels free to
organize your thoughts into a chart such as the following:

|                                                      | Strengths of model | Aspects Unique to this Model | Questions |
|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|-----------|

**Topic 2: The Community of Truth (Palmer, 2017)**

Palmer’s learning community model (2017) incorporates both learning and
community with a “subject” as the center, surrounded by “knowers” who are in
relationship to both each other and the subject. Palmer (2017) assets that “the
community of truth, far from being linear and static and hierarchical, is
circular, interactive, and dynamic” (p. 106).

Figure 4.1: Palmer’s Community of Truth model. From
https://uncc.instructure.com/courses/342/pages/module-3-why-discussions

The learning that takes place in this model is captured in this statement: “I
understand truth as the passionate and disciplined process of inquiry and
dialogue itself, as the dynamic conversation of a community that keeps testing
old conclusions and coming into new ones” (p. 106).

As teachers, we approach teaching with some sense that we have some thing (some
subject) to teach students. Palmer (2017) challenges us to think differently
about the teaching/learning experience. (See “The Objectivist Myth of Knowing,”
p. 103 and “The Community of Truth,” p. 105).

Instead of solely focusing on what we must teach (and what students must learn),
Palmer challenges us to consider how we all might learn something more together
– more than is already known – through the teaching/learning experience. In this
way, we must consider that we are not just engaged in transferring information
or knowledge, but that (in addition to that), together we might create new
knowledge.

“I know of no field, from science to religion, where what we regard as objective
knowledge did not emerge from long and complex communal discourse that continues
to this day, no field where the facts of the matter were delivered fully formed
from on high” (Palmer, 2017, p. 107).

Palmer’s (2017) model highlights the relational knowledge of learning
communities, underscoring not just the relationship of the people involved, but
also the relationships between people and subject. As you consider facilitating
learning communities, give some thought to your own relationship to the subject
to be taught and learned. Consider whether you “know” this subject objectively
or subjectively.

#### Learning Activity 4.2: 

Read *The Courage to Teach,* Chapter 4 “Knowing in Community” (Palmer, 2017). In
your Reflective Journal, write down three strengths of this learning community
model. Write 2-3 questions you have about this learning community. Do you think
this model accurately reflects the type of learning community you want to
create? Why or Why not?

**Topic 3: The Trinity Community of Inquiry (Madland, 2017)**

In our online courses, Trinity Western University seeks to create learning
communities that engage student learning on a cognitive, social, and spiritual
level. The Trinity Community of Inquiry model is a visual representation of
these three aspects of learning (Social, Cognitive, and Spiritual), and how they
interact with each other. At the intersections of these elements, you find:

1.  Community of Inquiry

2.  Community of Faith

3.  Integration of Faith and Reason

Combined, these three elements can lead to transformational learning – an
aspiration we hold in this course and program – and a fundamental goal of higher
education in a broader sense.

#### Activity 4.3: 

Review the *Trinity Community of Inquiry* model here**. [insert link to Colin’s
document].** In your Reflective Journal, write down three strengths of this
learning community model. Write 2-3 questions you have about this learning
community? Do you think this model accurately reflects the type of learning
community you want to create? Why or Why not?

#### Activity 4.4: 

After completing Learning Activities 4.1-3, write a 250-word blog. Provide a
brief description of each of the three models (with citations as appropriate).
Select the learning community model that most closely aligns with your identity
and values as a teacher/facilitator. In your blog, tell your readers the
strengths you see in this model, explaining why it resonates with your concepts
of teaching and learning.

Unit 4 Summary
--------------

The learning community models we have considered in this unit share some
similarities. In each model, there is an awareness that learners and learning is
multidimensional. As we engage in teaching and learning, we must always be aware
that the learning process is, fundamentally, transformative. It engages people,
not only on an intellectual level, but also on a spiritual and social level. By
designing curriculum, pedagogy, and learning around all aspects of learning –
social, cognitive, and spiritual – we provide the foundation for
transformational learning.

Palmer (2017) puts it this way: “The reality we belong to, the reality we long
to know, extends far beyond human beings interacting with one another… This is a
community held together not only by our personal powers of thought and feeling
but also by the power of ‘the grace of great things’” (p. 109). As Palmer (2017)
points out, learning includes both thought (cognitive) and feeling (social), but
also something beyond those – the overarching spiritual nature of life and
learning.
